Companion Planting
==================

(http://www.companionplanting.org)

Since I started Aquaponics a while back (see http://bot.co.za for a few photos if you are interested in growing plants and fish for crop together) I've also grown interested in companion planting; i.e. what plants go well and don't go well with one another. Some argue that the benefits of companion planting do not apply to aquaponics as it is foremost the soil chemistry that matters which in aquaponics, as it is soil-less, cannot work, but I hope that some benfits can be gained in terms of pest control and perhaps above-soil chemistry.

The focus of companionplanting.org is not aquaponics however. Technically, I am interested in building a Zotonic powered website and companion planting just happens to be a topic I like.

I am documenting my progress tutorial-style in the wiki here https://github.com/hcvst/companionplanting/wiki.
